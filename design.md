It is an a simple dotnet core library app with some unit test project (nUnit) and some console app left for manual testing.
Sdk contains some main Service and models, basically service would be used for work with sdk logic. Main part of service - httpClient (used as Singleton).
I try to keep all things simple and laconic, so I don't have any specific structure or smtn else in this project.
